All files are required to be in YAML format, so indentation is of the utmost importance for the successful operation of this code.

Reflex document export from Magnum is in SQL Lite format, with each individual document within being presented in this repository for any manual work that may be required. Primary reliance should be on the exported database file, to facilitate easy import within Magnum for quick restoration in an urgent situation.

The additional YAML documents presented here serve the purpose of a readable collection for understanding the inner workings of this Reflex code, as well as tracking any edits performed when services are added, removed, or modified.

Any questions arising from this code should be raised with Tony Antoniou or Jayesh Kothiya.
